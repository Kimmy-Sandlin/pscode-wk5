// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

Allows user to calculate the sum of two numbers

	x == first number

	y == second number

	z == sum

	if "x" + "y" then

		print "z"

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

Allows user to check if number is even or odd

	x == number

	if "x" is odd then

		print "odd"

	elseif "x" is even

		print "even"

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

Allow users to enter five numbers

	Read num1, num2, num3, num4, num5

Calculate the average of the entered numbers

	sum = num1 + num2 + num3 + num4 + num5 

	avg = sum/5

Locate the smallest number and largest number of the 5 numbers

	smallest number == min

	largest number == max

	set min/max

Results

	if avg then

		Print avg with message "average of 5 numbers"

	if min then 

		Print min with message "minimum"

	elseif max then 

		Print max with message "maximum"
